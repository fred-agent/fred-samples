What one run should do, decided before anything is written or fetched.

Nothing here touches the share or Fred, which is what lets every rule below be
tested on its own — above all the two that decide whether a team keeps its
documents: when an absence means a deletion, and when a file this run cannot
carry must be left exactly as it is.
