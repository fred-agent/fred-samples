The seam where this Knowledge Base hands documents to Fred.

Documents go through Knowledge Flow's synchronizing ingestion surface, using
the SDK's own publisher — so this sample writes no authentication code and
holds no store credential. A Knowledge Base never writes to OpenSearch or
object storage directly. Fred accepts a write and ingests it afterwards; the
boundary follows each one to its end, so a document counted as written has
actually landed.

Without a Knowledge Flow URL in the environment the boundary only logs, which
is what lets `make sync` run against a real share with no Fred at all.
