"""Tools for advancing a task record owned by a Fred application.

The session id comes from the runtime identity and is deliberately not a tool
parameter: a prompt must not be able to move an agent onto another
conversation's task.

Installing this package *is* the registration -- the agents pod discovers it at
boot through the ``fred.capabilities`` entry point in pyproject.toml. Until
``PROGRESS_TRACKER_API_BASE`` is set it contributes no tools, so a pod that
merely has it installed is unchanged.
